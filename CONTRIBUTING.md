## Commit messages
In order to create releases the commit message need to contain an indication to what level of change the commit contains. There are three options to relate to the different release types in [semantic versioning][semver]:

* Major: `:boom:` :boom:
* Minor: `:sparkles:` :sparkles:
* Patch: `:bug:` :bug:
